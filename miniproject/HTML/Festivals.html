                            Sunflower members are also active in participation of the annual town fiesta in December, the Mayflower festivities and religious celebrations like Holy Week. Indeed, they may be gay but they are truly and undoubtedly assets to the community.

                        <h1>The Dumadara Festival</h1>
                        <p>An annual fluvial parade festival started by the Davileneos, particularly the Roman Catholic Parish of St. Francis of Assisi. Davila is a coastal barangay of Pasuquin, and their main harvest is dumadara (a certain fish). They associated the festival to the Blessed Virgin Mary, whom the Month of May is dedicated, as a thanksgiving for a bountiful fishing. Fisherfolks from Davila are made to decorate their bangkas (boats) for the fluvial parade. There are many activities hold also during the festival like boat race, and eating delectable grilled fish (Dumadara)with the guests.</p>
