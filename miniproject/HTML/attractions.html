                This fortress was built by the Spaniards as watchtower for some pirates roaming the ocean for their victims. The grotto they alleged to have some apparitions were never verified by either the government or the Church, yet some people believe that the grotto has healed some illness and brought some luck to fishermen. This depends on one's belief.

                The bakery was named after the province of Pasuquin and remained the only original branch in the area. Their goal was to make their products synonymous with the province. They also want to make it a part of your itinerary when you visit the province. True enough, their initial offer to the market is their one-of-a-kind biscocho. This, later on, became one of the North’s pride.

                Along the highway a few kilometers north of the town of Pasuquin, there are roadside stalls selling bags of what is arguably the finest salt in the Philippines. It is a common sight to see people riding in provincial buses that often stop at these stalls to purchase salt. Sold by the kilo and contained in plastic bags, the salt is cooked in large vats in huts which are usually found behind the stalls.
